# Mini Canva Demo

This project is a small design editor built with React and Fabric.js. It allows
adding text, shapes and images, editing font and fill colour and exporting the
result just like a lightweight version of Canva.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Add text with custom font and size
- Draw rectangles, circles and triangles
- Upload background, photos, logos and signatures
- Layer objects forward/backward and to top/bottom
- Clone or delete selected objects
- Undo/redo canvas changes
- Export the canvas as an image or save the template


## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
